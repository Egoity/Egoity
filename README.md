Hiya, welcome to my GitHub page. I hope you can make yourself cozy; I don't know how much this will fill up. 

This is my second GitHub account, and I lost my previous one, which I started about 10 years back. 

With that account, much of my prior computer science knowledge has also been lost since I entered medicine.

As such, I feel this account is an appropriate fresh start where I will take a more structured approach to learning the computer sciences again.

I hope to begin with teachyourselfcs.com and move onto AI/DS roadmaps.
